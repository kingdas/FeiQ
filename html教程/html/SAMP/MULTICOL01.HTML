<H2>What is our Aim?</H2>

<P>Transmitting the information can be said as communication between sender
and clinets. How can we design better communication through the networks?
<BR>
Now we have many method such as Web, E-mail, Realtime video and more to
communicate on the Internet. It is quite different from ordinary media,
and there should be new designing rules. To find them, we provide the tips
to put up the information to the net, make research into communication
design, and have mailing list as discussion space. </P>

<H2>Aspects of Design</H2>

<P>The word &quot;design&quot; has some aspects. One aspect is surface
design such as layout, coloring, video editting etc. Another is systematic
design such as data base, transfer sytem, link structure, etc. We need
to think about those aspects together as &quot;design&quot; to make better
communication on the net. </P>

<H2>Better Browsingwe try to create NCD pages included available functions:
HTML2.0 (basic tags), Netscape and Internet Explorer Extensions, but we
always care that these pages can be browsed by any kind of browsers. Now,
there is no browser supports all kinds of functions. So it is better to
use some different browsers, and take a look their different appearance.
